# to-do list
- customize dots at bottom
- adjust height
- add asteroid spinny thing
- adjust spacing of flexbox on phones
- move header closer down and footer a bit up 
- currently the asteroid takes the size of the one after it... fix that issue
- another issue: get the asteroid inside the box, and figure out how to change the settings of its position based on the width and height of the screen
